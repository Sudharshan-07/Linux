### what is the need for sysfs filesystem?:
1. sysfs is a feature of the Linux kernel 2.6 that allows kernel code to export information to user processes via an in-memory filesystem. The organization of the filesystem directory is
strict and based the internal organization of kernel data structures.
2. sysfs is a mechanism of representing kernel objects(kobjects), their attributes, and their relationships with each other. It provides two components: a kernel programming interface for
   exporting these items via sysfs and a user interface to view and manipulate these items that map back to kernel objects that they represent.
3. The table below shows the mapping between their internal(kernel) constructs and external(userspace) sysfs mappings.
